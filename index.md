# About Me

I am currently a research assistant at **Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)**, under the supervision of [Prof. Hongyan Wu](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~hywu). Before that, I have worked at **Bytedance** for one year. I received my master's degree from **University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)** (under the supervision of [Prof. Hongyan Wu](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~hywu) and [Prof. Yunpeng Cai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_N0JJiEAAAAJ)) and bachelor's degree from **Jinan University (JNU)**. For more information, you can find my detailed CV [here](https://caihanlin.com/file/CV_Yijia_Zheng.pdf). If you are interested in my research and want to have further discussion with me, feel free to drop me an email! 

I will start my PhD study at **University of Amsterdam (UvA)**, under the supervision of [Prof. Marcel Worring](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.worring/). Look forward to that!

## Research Interests

- Graph Neural Networks
- Deep Generative Models
- Transferability in Deep Learning
- Neural-symbolic AI

I have a broad interest in Machine Learning, including theoretical research and application research. I have some experience in applying deep learning methods in bioinformatics, like molecular optimization, single-cell data integration and bulk data deconvolution. Besides, I also have some experience in social media data processing and developing some algorithms for advertising business on Tiktok, like CTR/CVR prediction and creative ranking. I am also happy to explore many other aspects about AI.
